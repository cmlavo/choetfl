Steps:

X. Obtain a set of different biomass reactions for different growth rates (from differing fractions of each biomass building block at 
	different specific growth rate values) from experimental data.
X. Plot growth rate with normal FBA and ETFL as afunction of glucose uptake, compare to experimental growth values (particularly 
	maximum growth observed in rich medium).
